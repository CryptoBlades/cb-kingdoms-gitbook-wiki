# Actions That Cost KING

In game, there will be many ways to spend KING. Almost every action will require it:

* upgrading a village
* sending an attack or support
* claiming a new village
* canceling anything
* nicknaming your wallet

Other things will not be handled with the blockchain, and thus will not cost skill:

* using the guild forum
* using the mail system
