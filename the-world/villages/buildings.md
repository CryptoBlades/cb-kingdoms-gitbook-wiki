# Buildings

Villages can create and upgrade any buildings in this list. Every building will cost resources \(stone, clay, wood\) to upgrade. Buildings at any level increase the score of the village, allowing any player to get a general grasp of how strong a particular village is.

## Town Hall

The town hall is the main building every village has. Here is where new building construction and upgrades are managed. To increase the level of a building, the Town Hall must be at least that level. If an upgrade is cancelled a proportional amount of resources will be returned back based on how long the upgrade takes, and how much time has been spent so far. The Town Hall can queue up to 2 building upgrades at a time.

The Town Hall has a max level of 10, and higher levels allow the village to build higher levels for other buildings.

## Headquarters

The Headquarters is where you can go to view CryptoBlades heroes associated with the current player wallet. Here, their level can be viewed as well as any other useful information for CBK.

The Headquarters has a max level of 1.

## Barracks

The Barracks is where you can view an army and recruit more units to it. Units have a recruitment time ranging from 5-30 seconds per unit, as well as a material cost. There are 5 units: Bruiser, Mage, Archer, Paladin, and Mercenary. More information about them can be found [here](military-units.md). The number of units that can be recruited is capped by the level in the Farm.

The Barracks has a max level of 10, and higher levels increase unit recruitment speed.

## Stone Mine

The Stone Mine generates stone for the village.

The Stone Mine has a max level of 6, and higher levels generate more stone per hour.

## Clay Pit

The Clay Pit generates stone for the village.

The Clay Pit has a max level of 6, and higher levels generate more clay per hour.

## Forest Camp

The Forest Camp generates stone for the village.

The Forest Camp has a max level of 6, and higher levels generate more wood per hour.

## Church

The Church is how the kingdom is expanded. Here, missionaries can be recruited - these units can be sent to lands near or far to claim them for a kingdom. Training a missionary takes a long time, however - 3 days. Once a missionary is recruited, it can be sent off to an unoccupied land to claim it. Beware, missionaries are slow! The missionary does not count towards the Farm unit cap.

## Storehouse

The Storehouse is where resources are stored. Resources are spent from the Storehouse as well. Upon filling the Storehouse, further resources gathered will be ignored.

The Storehouse has a max level of 10, and higher levels allow for more storage space.

## Smithy

The Smithy reduces the build time of other buildings, as well as buffing the offensive capabilities of units sent from this village.

The Smithy has a max level of 6, and higher levels buff units and build time more.

## Rally Point

The Rally Point is where players go to issue commands to their heroes and military units.

Here, you can issue an **attack** or **support** command. Attacks are sending your units to another village to plunder resources and kill troops, whereas a support command allows you to bolster another villages forces. 

In the case of a support command, you can recall your troops at any time while they're at the destination village.

Additionally, you can always cancel _any_ order while it's in progress, but the units must spend the same amount of time they already have to come back.

## Farm

The Farm limits how many military units can be recruited for a particular village. Upon reaching the cap, further recruitments will be paused temporarily.

The Farm has a max level of 10, and higher levels allow for more military units to be recruited.

## Hidden Stash

The Hidden Stash allows some resources to be kept when losing a combat as the defender. 

The Hidden Stash has a max level of 6, and higher levels allow for more resources to be kept.

## Wall

The Wall buffs the defensive capabilities of stationed military units.

The Wall has a max level of 6, and higher levels buff the defense of stationed military units in this village.
