# Traversal

Traveling between hexes in the world is not instant. Going from one tile to another takes 15 minutes, which means 375 minutes \(6.25 hours\) to travel from one end of a chunk to the other.

To illustrate, given a perfect path, it would take 125 hours to travel from any corner to any other corner.

To encourage short trips, traversal within a chunk is half of the time it would normally be, as most players will spend time within their chunk more than anything else. 

If a player owns villages in both chunks, the "current" chunk refers to the chunk the village that executed the traveling order is from.
