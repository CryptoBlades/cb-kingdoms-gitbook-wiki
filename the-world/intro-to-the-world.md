# Intro to the World

The world of CryptoBlades: Kingdoms will be a 5000x5000 area, with 25 million claimable territory locations. This large area will be subdivided into 50x50 chunks for a total of 400 "**chunks**". 

The entire world will reside on one blockchain per game instance, but there may be multiple game instances across multiple blockchains. The game will be on BSC, but plan to expand to others.

The world will visually be represented as hexes instead of the traditional tiles.

Each claimable territory node can have a **village** or a **dungeon** \(or be empty\). 

All villages will have 3 primary resources: **stone**, **clay**, and **wood**. These resources are used to upgrade and construct new buildings as well as recruit troops.
