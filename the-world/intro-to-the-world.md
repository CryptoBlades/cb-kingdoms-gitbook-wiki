# Intro to the World

The world of CryptoBlades: Kingdoms will be a 1000x1000 area, with 1 million claimable territory locations. This large area will be subdivided into 50x50 chunks for a total of 400 "**chunks**". 

These chunks will be allocated to different networks at different times, so they won't all be available initially when CryptoBlades: Kingdoms launches. For example, chunks 1, 15, 37, and 60 could be allocated to BSC while chunks 2, 40, 50, 60 could be allocated to Polygon. More chunks will be released as time goes on, too, to fill out the world.

The world will visually be represented as hexes instead of the traditional tiles.

Each claimable territory node can have a **village**.
