# Daily Quests



Daily Quests are kingdom-wide quests that are doable per player, per day. Doing a quest will reward a useful amount of KING, and completing a set of them \(5 will be given per day, 3 need to be done\) will yield more KING. Quests can also reward clay, stone, and wood.

Some daily quest examples are:

* Upgrade a building
* Send an attack
* Support an ally
* Explore a dungeon
* Conquer a new land
* Explore a specific dungeon
