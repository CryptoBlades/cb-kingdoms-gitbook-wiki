# Forming a Guild

Anyone can form a guild. However, guilds are limited to 50 players \(not villages\). 

Guilds have three recruitment settings: **open**, **invite-only / request**, and **closed**. Guilds with open invitation allow anyone to join as desired. Guilds with invite-only / request invitation require a senior member of the guild to invite any newcomers, and newcomers can apply to the guild. Guilds with closed invitation cannot have join requests, but can still send out invites.

Guilds have 4 roles: leader, moderator, member and basic. Leaders can appoint new moderators and leaders, as well as take any moderator actions. Moderators can only take moderator actions. Members do not have any special functionality, but can view guild boards. Basic members do not have any privileges whatsoever. Leaders and moderators can set the default role a joining member is.

Moderator functionality includes: inviting a player, kicking a player, managing invitations, managing messages on the forum, and viewing the audit log.

It is advantageous to join a nearby guild, as players can much more easily support each other this way.
