# Exploring Dungeons

Exploring a dungeon is like in an MMO. When a group arrives at a dungeon, the actions happen all at once \(so rewards are guaranteed when a group arrives at the dungeon\) but depending on the number of fights in the dungeon, the delay to come back is longer. 

Combat will play out for each segment, and heroes will either be exhausted \(contribute no more damage\) or military units will die \(and thus not come back\). Loot is obtained post-battle, with 1 random reward per segment.
