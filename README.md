# CryptoBlades: Kingdoms Intro

DEPRECATED: the wiki is now here: https://cbk-wiki.apps.cryptoblades.io/

CryptoBlades: Kingdoms is a modular additional game to CryptoBlades. It brings a persistent browser-based game \(PBBG\) game to the CryptoBlades universe.

A PBBG is similar to a 4x game: it allows you to explore lands, expand your kingdom, exploit the lands resources, and exterminate your enemies. However, in CryptoBlades: Kingdoms, we're putting a unique twist on PBBG gameplay utilizing cryptocurrency.
